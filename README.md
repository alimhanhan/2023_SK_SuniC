<h3>👁️‍🗨️ Discovering Challenges in Bus Boarding for the Visually Impaired</h3>

<h4>ㅤThe issue of mobility challenges for the visually impaired, particularly the difficulty in boarding buses, has been consistently highlighted through various media outlets.<br><br>
ㅤIn fact, 82% of visually impaired survey respondents have indicated that buses are the most challenging mode of transportation among all available options.<br><br>
ㅤAs shown in the graph above, the bus utilization rate among the visually impaired is even lower than the overall transportation-disabled population, underscoring the considerable difficulties they face in accessing and utilizing buses. </h4><br><hr><br>

<h4>ㅤEven excluding buses, using other modes of transportation is not necessarily easier. Welfare call taxis, a special type of taxi service for the visually impaired, are available.<br><br>
 ㅤHowever, out of 10 visually impaired individuals who request welfare call taxis, 4 are unable to board the taxi. Even if they manage to get a welfare call taxi, during peak commuting hours, they often have to wait for more than 2 hours due to high demand.<br><br>
ㅤFurthermore, only around 20% of visually impaired applicants receive assistance from guide dogs for the visually impaired. Consequently, the issue of the mobility rights of the visually impaired has consistently been raised, given that the help from guide dogs is limited to a relatively small portion of the visually impaired population.</h4>

<h3>🎓 취약점 보완 코드</h3>

<summary>Code 1️⃣_장애물을 만날 때 로봇의 방향 번경 전 앞에 장애물이 있는지를 검사하는 과정 추가</summary><br>
<div markdown="1">
 
  —> 장애물이 있는 경우 장애물을 피할 방향을 결정하고, 장애물이 없는 방향으로 변경하여 이동한다. 이를 위해 `Left()`와 `Right()`함수를 이용하여 로봇을 각 방향으로 회전시키고, `Distance_Measurement()`함수를 이용하여 회전한 방향으로부터의 거리를 측정한다. 이후 거리가 더 긴 방향으로 회전하여 이동한다.
